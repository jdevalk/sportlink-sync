# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-24
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

This milestone enhanced an existing sync pipeline with automation-ready output and scheduled execution. Phase 1 converted verbose console output into concise summaries suitable for email reports. Phase 2 configured cron to run daily syncs with automated email delivery.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Summary Output

**Goal**: Sync produces clean, concise output suitable for email delivery
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: OUT-01, OUT-02, OUT-03
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Logger infrastructure and script modularization
- [x] 01-02: Summary orchestrator with email-ready output

**Details:**
Created dual-stream logger module writing to stdout and date-based log files. Modularized download, prepare, and submit scripts with exportable functions returning stats objects. Built sync-all orchestrator producing clean summary with timestamp, duration, totals, per-list breakdown, and grouped errors.

### Phase 2: Cron Automation

**Goal**: Daily sync runs automatically with email reports on completion
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: AUTO-01, AUTO-02
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Cron wrapper and install scripts

**Details:**
Created cron wrapper script with flock-based locking, environment loading, and email delivery with custom subjects. Built cron install script prompting for operator email and configuring timezone-aware crontab entries (6:00 AM Amsterdam time with 8:00 AM retry on failure).

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Logger uses native Console class with two streams (stdout + file)
- Scripts remain CLI-compatible while exporting main functions
- Summary format uses plain text dividers (40 chars) for email readability
- Added/updated distinction based on Laposta API timestamps
- Cron timezone: Europe/Amsterdam
- Email delivery in wrapper script (enables custom subject lines)
- Retry timing: 2-hour delay after failure
- Lockfile location: .cron.lock in project root

**Issues Resolved:**
- Verbose output unsuitable for email reports
- No automated scheduling capability
- No email notification on sync completion

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
