# Phase 46 Plan 02: FreeScout Conversations Pipeline Integration

**One-liner:** Complete end-to-end pipeline for syncing FreeScout conversations to Rondo Club activity timeline with deduplication, error handling, and CLI integration.

## What Was Built

### 1. Submit Step (`steps/submit-freescout-activities.js`)

Submits FreeScout conversation activities to Rondo Club Activities API and marks conversations as synced in SQLite.

**Core logic:**
1. Accepts pre-prepared activities array or runs prepare step internally
2. Opens conversations database for sync tracking
3. For each activity:
   - Defensive check: skip if conversation already synced (query `rondo_club_activity_id IS NOT NULL`)
   - POST to `rondo/v1/people/{personId}/activities` via `rondoClubRequestWithRetry`
   - Extract activity ID from response body
   - Mark conversation as synced via `markConversationSynced(db, conversationId, activityId)`
   - 100ms delay between API calls (rate limiting)
   - Per-activity try/catch - errors logged but don't stop pipeline
4. Returns: `{ success, total, created, skipped, failed, errors }`

**Error handling:** Non-critical per-activity errors. Failed submissions logged with conversation ID, person ID, and error message. Pipeline continues to next activity.

**Deduplication strategy:** Two-layer defense:
- SQLite `rondo_club_activity_id` column tracks synced conversations (set by `markConversationSynced`)
- Defensive check before POST prevents duplicate API calls if sync tracking fails

**CLI:** `node steps/submit-freescout-activities.js [--verbose]`

### 2. Pipeline Orchestrator (`pipelines/sync-freescout-conversations.js`)

Complete pipeline following sync-freescout.js pattern with credential check, RunTracker, and comprehensive summary.

**Pipeline flow:**
1. Check FreeScout credentials via `checkFreescoutCredentials()` - exit early if not configured
2. Create RunTracker('freescout-conversations')
3. **Step 1:** Download conversations (`runDownloadConversations`)
   - Tracks: totalCustomers, totalConversations, newConversations
   - Step tracked via `tracker.startStep('conversations-download')`
4. **Step 2:** Prepare activity payloads (`runPrepareActivities`)
   - Tracks: total, prepared, skipped (no Rondo Club ID)
   - Step tracked via `tracker.startStep('activities-prepare')`
5. **Step 3:** Submit to Rondo Club (`runSubmitActivities` with prepared activities)
   - Tracks: total, created, skipped, failed, errors
   - Step tracked via `tracker.startStep('activities-submit')`
6. End run with outcome ('success'|'partial'|'failure')
7. Print comprehensive summary with dividers

**printSummary sections:**
- Completed/Duration
- CONVERSATION DOWNLOAD: customers processed, conversations found, new conversations
- ACTIVITY PREPARATION: total, prepared, skipped (no Rondo Club ID)
- ACTIVITY SUBMISSION: total, created, skipped, failed
- ERRORS: up to 10 errors displayed (download + submit combined)

**CLI:** `node pipelines/sync-freescout-conversations.js [--verbose] [--force]`

### 3. CLI Integration (`scripts/sync.sh`)

Added `conversations` as sync type option 11.

**Changes:**
- Interactive menu: added option 11 with description "FreeScout conversations as activities"
- Choice range updated from [1-10] to [1-11]
- Validation case statement: added `conversations` to valid types
- Script mapping: `conversations)` → `SYNC_SCRIPT="sync-freescout-conversations.js"`
- Help comment updated to include `sync.sh conversations` usage

**Usage:** `scripts/sync.sh conversations [--verbose] [--force]`

### 4. Full Sync Integration (`pipelines/sync-all.js`)

Conversations sync added as Step 7b (non-critical, within FreeScout credentials check).

**Changes:**
- Import: `runFreescoutConversationsSync` from `./sync-freescout-conversations`
- Stats initialization: `freescoutConversations: { total, created, skipped, failed, errors }`
- Step 7b execution (after Step 7 FreeScout customer sync):
  - Only runs if `freescoutCreds.configured`
  - Maps `convResult.stats.submit` to `stats.freescoutConversations`
  - Errors caught and logged, pipeline continues
- Summary output: FREESCOUT CONVERSATIONS section after FREESCOUT SYNC
  - Shows activities created, skipped, failed
  - Shows "Conversations synced: 0 changes" if no activity
- Error tracking: `stats.freescoutConversations.errors` added to both `allErrors` and `allErrorArrays`

**Pattern:** Follows discipline sync pattern - non-critical step that enriches sync-all without blocking on failure.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Results

All verification steps passed:

1. ✓ `steps/submit-freescout-activities.js` loads without error
2. ✓ `pipelines/sync-freescout-conversations.js` loads without error
3. ✓ `pipelines/sync-all.js` loads without error (no broken imports)
4. ✓ `scripts/sync.sh` validates `conversations` as sync type (5 matches found)
5. ✓ Pipeline follows RunTracker pattern with step tracking
6. ✓ Submit step marks conversations as synced after successful API call

## Key Technical Details

### API Integration

**Endpoint:** `POST /wp-json/rondo/v1/people/{personId}/activities`

**Payload structure:**
```javascript
{
  content: "<p><strong>Subject</strong></p><p><a href=\"...\">Bekijk in FreeScout</a></p>",
  activity_type: "email",
  activity_date: "2026-02-12",
  activity_time: "14:30"
}
```

**Response:** `{ id: 12345, ... }` - activity ID extracted and stored in SQLite

**Retry logic:** Uses `rondoClubRequestWithRetry` with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) for 5xx errors

### Deduplication Flow

1. Download step: conversations upserted to SQLite (by conversation_id UNIQUE constraint)
2. Prepare step: queries unsynced conversations (`WHERE rondo_club_activity_id IS NULL`)
3. Submit step (defensive layer):
   - Before POST: check if `rondo_club_activity_id IS NOT NULL`
   - If exists: skip with log message
   - If null: proceed with POST
4. After successful POST: `markConversationSynced` sets `rondo_club_activity_id` and `last_synced_at`

**Why defensive check?** Prevents duplicate API calls if:
- Another process synced the conversation between prepare and submit
- Prepare step cache is stale
- Manual testing/debugging scenarios

### Pipeline Orchestration Pattern

Follows established patterns from `sync-freescout.js` and `sync-nikki.js`:
- Credential validation before any work
- RunTracker for dashboard integration (run tracking, step tracking, error recording)
- Stats object with nested sections (download, prepare, submit)
- Non-critical step error handling (try/catch per step, continue on failure)
- Comprehensive printSummary with dividers and conditional sections
- CLI entry point with verbose/force flags

### Integration Points

**sync.sh → pipeline:**
- Shell script maps `conversations` sync type to `sync-freescout-conversations.js`
- Passes through `--verbose` and `--force` flags
- Uses flock-based locking to prevent concurrent runs
- Sends failure alerts via Postmark on non-zero exit code

**sync-all.js → pipeline:**
- Runs conversations sync only if FreeScout credentials configured
- Places conversations sync after customer sync (Step 7b after Step 7)
- Aggregates stats into sync-all summary
- Includes errors in total error count
- Non-blocking: conversations sync failure doesn't fail sync-all

## Next Steps

This completes Phase 46 (FreeScout Conversations as Activities). The pipeline is now operational via:

1. **Manual execution:** `scripts/sync.sh conversations`
2. **Full sync inclusion:** `scripts/sync.sh all` (includes conversations sync)
3. **Direct CLI:** `node pipelines/sync-freescout-conversations.js [--verbose] [--force]`

**Recommended cron schedule:** Daily at 8:15am (after FreeScout customer sync at 8:00am)
```
15 8 * * * /path/to/sync.sh conversations
```

**Monitoring:** Pipeline runs tracked in dashboard database (`data/dashboard.sqlite`) via RunTracker. Check dashboard for:
- Run outcomes (success/partial/failure)
- Step-level outcomes
- Error details
- Duration metrics
