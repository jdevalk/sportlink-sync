# Phase 34 Plan 01: Infrastructure Foundation Summary

**WAL journal mode and busy_timeout on all 5 SQLite databases, new dashboard-db.js with runs/run_steps/run_errors schema, Node.js 22 verified on production**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-08T14:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-08T14:38:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- WAL mode and 5-second busy_timeout added to all 5 existing database modules (laposta, rondo-club, freescout, nikki, discipline)
- New `lib/dashboard-db.js` with `runs`, `run_steps`, and `run_errors` tables — all including `club_slug` column
- Node.js v22.22.0 confirmed on production server
- FreeScout pipeline verified post-deploy (1062 customers, no errors)
- People pipeline running successfully with new WAL-enabled code

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add WAL mode and busy_timeout to all 5 existing database modules** - `271f312` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create dashboard database module with run tracking schema** - `8b80826` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Deploy and verify on production server** - manual verification (no code commit)

## Files Created/Modified
- `lib/laposta-db.js` - Added WAL + busy_timeout to openDb()
- `lib/rondo-club-db.js` - Added WAL + busy_timeout to openDb()
- `lib/freescout-db.js` - Added WAL + busy_timeout to openDb()
- `lib/nikki-db.js` - Added WAL + busy_timeout to openDb()
- `lib/discipline-db.js` - Added WAL + busy_timeout to openDb()
- `lib/dashboard-db.js` - New module: dashboard database with run tracking schema

## Decisions Made
- 5000ms busy_timeout chosen for concurrent access — enough time for writes without excessive blocking

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All databases WAL-enabled and ready for concurrent access from cron + web server
- Dashboard schema ready for Phase 35 (Run Tracking) to add CRUD helpers
- No blockers
