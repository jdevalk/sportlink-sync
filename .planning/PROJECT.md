# Rondo Sync

## What This Is

A sync system with web dashboard that synchronizes member data bidirectionally between Sportlink Club (a Dutch sports club management system) and multiple destinations: Laposta email marketing lists and Rondo Club (a WordPress-based member management app). It downloads member data via browser automation, transforms it according to field mappings, syncs changes to both destinations including photos and team assignments, enables corrections in Rondo Club to flow back to Sportlink via browser automation, runs automatically on scheduled intervals, and provides a web dashboard for monitoring sync status, browsing run history, and investigating errors with per-user authentication and error-only email alerts.

## Core Value

Keep downstream systems (Laposta, Rondo Club) automatically in sync with Sportlink member data without manual intervention — now bidirectionally, with web-based monitoring.

## Current State (v3.1 Shipped)

**Shipped:** 2026-02-09

Everything from v3.0 plus a one-time former member import tool:
- All SQLite databases use WAL mode with busy_timeout for concurrent cron + web server access
- Dashboard database (dashboard.sqlite) stores structured run data: timing, per-step counts, individual errors
- RunTracker class instruments all 7 pipelines with safety-wrapped methods (tracking failures never crash pipelines)
- Fastify web server at https://sync.rondo.club with Argon2id auth, SQLite sessions, nginx/TLS, systemd
- Pipeline overview page with traffic-light status (green/yellow/red) and overdue detection
- Run history with paginated list, run detail with per-step breakdown
- Error browser with filtering by pipeline/date and drill-down to individual member failures with stack traces
- Error-only email alerts replace always-send reports; periodic overdue checks with 4-hour cooldown
- Server-rendered HTML (EJS templates), responsive layout, no build step
- One-time import tool fetches inactive members from Sportlink and syncs to Rondo Club as former members with photos

### Active

(None — define with `/gsd:new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

- Real-time sync — scheduled batch sync is appropriate for member data
- Slack/Discord notifications — Email alerts are sufficient for 3-10 users
- Delete sync — Members removed from Sportlink stay in downstream systems
- Three-way merge — Last-edit-wins is simpler and predictable
- Bidirectional photo sync — Photos only flow Sportlink → Rondo Club
- Full bidirectional sync — Only specific fields sync back; Sportlink remains primary source
- Real-time auto-refresh (<60s) — Pipelines run 4x/day max; 60-second polling sufficient
- Full log streaming via WebSocket — Over-engineered for internal tool
- Member data CRUD — That is WordPress/Sportlink's job
- Pipeline configuration UI — Too dangerous; SSH for config changes
- React/SPA frontend — Massive overhead for read-only dashboard
- Docker/containerization — Single-server deployment; adds complexity for no benefit
- TypeScript migration — Would split codebase; project is pure JavaScript

## Context

**Codebase:**
- ~23,100 lines of JavaScript + shell
- Node.js 22 with Playwright for browser automation
- SQLite for state tracking (6 databases: Laposta, Rondo Club, FreeScout, Nikki, Discipline, Dashboard)
- Fastify v5 web server with EJS templates
- Shell scripts for cron automation

**Tech stack:** Node.js 22, Playwright/Chromium, SQLite (WAL mode), Fastify, EJS, Bash, Postmark, WordPress REST API, nginx, systemd, Argon2id

**Server:** Single server at 46.202.155.16, web dashboard at https://sync.rondo.club

**Known issues:**
- INFRA-04 partial: web server runs as root (no sportlink user on server)
- MULTI-02 deferred: multi-club architecture for when second club onboards

## Constraints

- **Runtime**: Node.js 22 with Playwright browser automation
- **Dependencies**: Requires Chromium for Sportlink scraping
- **Network**: Needs access to club.sportlink.com, api.laposta.nl, api.postmarkapp.com, and Rondo Club WordPress site
- **Credentials**: Sportlink username/password/OTP secret, Laposta API key, Postmark API key, Rondo Club application password, SESSION_SECRET in `.env`
- **Deployment**: Single server, no containerization

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Browser automation for Sportlink | No API available, must scrape web interface | ✓ Good |
| SQLite for state tracking | Simple, no external database needed, portable | ✓ Good |
| Hash-based change detection | Avoids timestamp issues, reliable diff detection | ✓ Good |
| Module/CLI hybrid pattern | Scripts work standalone and as imports | ✓ Good |
| KNVB ID as primary match key | Stable identifier from Sportlink (relatiecode) | ✓ Good |
| Parents as separate persons | Enables proper relationship modeling | ✓ Good |
| MemberHeader API capture | Already fetched during scraping, zero overhead | ✓ Good |
| Per-field timestamp tracking | Enables field-level conflict detection | ✓ Good |
| Playwright for reverse sync | Sportlink lacks API for member updates | ✓ Good |
| Birthdate as ACF field | Eliminates complex important_date lifecycle | ✓ Good |
| WAL mode + busy_timeout | Enables concurrent cron + web server database access | ✓ Good |
| RunTracker safety wrapping | Tracking failures never crash pipelines | ✓ Good |
| Fastify + EJS (no SPA) | Server-rendered HTML, no build step, minimal overhead | ✓ Good |
| Argon2id password hashing | OWASP recommended, memory-hard | ✓ Good |
| SQLite session store | Persistence across restarts, no memory leak | ✓ Good |
| Error-only email alerts | Dashboard is source of truth, emails only for action needed | ✓ Good |
| Periodic overdue checks in web server | 30-min interval with 4-hour cooldown prevents spam | ✓ Good |
| Systemd service runs as root | No sportlink user on server; accepted for now | ⚠️ Revisit |
| 3-strategy status filter toggle | Resilient to Sportlink UI changes (ID → text → role fallback) | ✓ Good |
| Dry-run-by-default import tool | Safe-by-default; --import flag required to execute | ✓ Good |
| Cached download results | Resume-after-failure without re-downloading from Sportlink | ✓ Good |
| Photo steps in import tool | Atomic operation; photo failures don't block member sync | ✓ Good |
