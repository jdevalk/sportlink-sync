# Utility Scripts

Reference for all utility, cleanup, inspection, and recovery scripts.

## Cleanup Scripts

### delete-duplicates.js

```bash
node tools/delete-duplicates.js --verbose   # Dry run (default)

```

**Safe by default:** Dry-run mode shows what would be deleted without making changes.

---

### merge-duplicate-person.js

Merges a parent record into a member record, reassigning all child relationships, then deletes the parent.

```bash
node tools/merge-duplicate-person.js --parent=123 --member=456
```

---

### cleanup-duplicate-relationships.js

Scans all people and removes duplicate relationships (same person + type) and self-referential relationships.

```bash
node tools/cleanup-duplicate-relationships.js
```

**Destructive:** Immediately removes duplicates. No dry-run mode.

---

### cleanup-orphan-relationships.js

Finds people with relationships pointing to non-existent person IDs and removes those orphaned relationships.

node tools/cleanup-orphan-relationships.js --fix       # Remove orphaned relationships
```

---

### cleanup-comma-teams.js

```

**Destructive:** Immediately clears work history. No dry-run mode.

---

```bash
node tools/verify-rondo-club-data.js --verbose           # Report only (default)
node tools/verify-rondo-club-data.js --fix --verbose      # Nullify invalid IDs for re-sync
